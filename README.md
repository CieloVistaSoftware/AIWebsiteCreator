# AIWebsiteCreator

This repository was created by GPT-4.1 using GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code.

## About
This project contains a clean HTML file (`website-creator-clean.html`) designed to help users quickly generate and customize websites. The goal is to showcase how AI tools can assist in web development and automation.

## Purpose
AIWebsiteCreator is intended for all AI enthusiasts who want to explore the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence in coding and website creation. While AI can accelerate development and provide helpful suggestions, it is important to note that AI-generated code is only about 40% correct and often requires human review and refinement.

## Features
- Simple, clean HTML template for website creation
- Demonstrates AI-assisted coding workflows
- Encourages experimentation and learning with AI tools

## Disclaimer
This repository is a demonstration of AI-assisted development. Please review and test all code before using it in production. AI is a powerful tool, but human expertise is essential for quality and reliability.
